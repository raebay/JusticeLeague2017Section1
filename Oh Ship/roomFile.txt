Engine Room A
You wake up with a slight headache. You get up. The last thing you can remember is aloud explosion and the engine room shaking. Seems like you're alone. Where did your crewmates go? Even after...whatever happened, the engine is still going, but the emergency lights are flashing. Other than that, nothing seems out of place. You wonder where your mate is and you notice some blood on the floor.

Locker Room
The room is hot as always, but you don't notice because you were sweating when you passed out anyways. All the lockers seem to be shut, as if no one took their belongings before departing. Your locker is also here, and doesn't appear to be tampered with. Is your stuff still in there?

Hall 2
You close the door to the locker room behind you, noticing the closed doors all along the hall. You could try to open them, but you know they won't lead to the deck. The door on one side is the main staircase that will take you to the exit. You hear some noise coming from the Supervisors Office.
