1.a
Engine Room 
You wake up with a slight headache. You get up. The last thing you can remember is aloud explosion and the engine room shaking. Seems like you're alone. Where did your crewmates go? Even after...whatever happened, the engine is still going, but the emergency lights are flashing. Other than that, nothing seems out of place. You wonder where your mate is and you notice some blood on the foor.
